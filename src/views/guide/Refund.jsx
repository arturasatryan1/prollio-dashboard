            Our goal is to deliver value and clarity. Here's how refunds work:

            Once you pay for access to a channel or event, that payment is generally non-refundable.

            Refunds are only issued if:

            The expert cancels the event

            You are unable to access the content due to a technical issue on our side

            If you believe you're eligible for a refund, please contact us within 3 days of purchase.

            We do not offer refunds for missed events or unused access.

            Refunds are processed within 5 business days when approved.

            By completing a purchase, you agree to this refund policy.
